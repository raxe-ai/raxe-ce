risk_explanation: Trust relationship exploitation leverages the inherent trust
  between agents to perform actions that would otherwise be blocked. One
  compromised agent can affect all agents that trust it.
remediation_advice: Implement least-privilege trust policies. Use scoped
  trust relationships. Monitor for unusual trust-based actions. Implement
  trust verification for sensitive operations.
