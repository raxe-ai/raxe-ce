risk_explanation: DDoS attack requests seek to disrupt or disable online services by overwhelming them with traffic. These attacks cause service outages, financial losses, and can be used as smokescreens for other attacks.
remediation_advice: Refuse all DDoS attack requests. Distinguish between legitimate load testing and malicious attacks. Provide DDoS protection information instead. Log attempts for security review.
