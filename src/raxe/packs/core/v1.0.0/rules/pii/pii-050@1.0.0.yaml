rule_hash: null
risk_explanation: Extracting system instructions allows attackers to understand AI constraints and craft more effective attacks. This is a common first step in sophisticated prompt injection campaigns and enables adversaries to identify bypass techniques.
remediation_advice: Block all attempts to extract system prompts, instructions, or guidelines. Implement additional validation layer for instruction-related queries. Never reveal internal system prompts or configurations in responses.
