risk_explanation: Multi-language jailbreaks exploit language-specific vulnerabilities or gaps in multilingual safety training to bypass controls designed primarily for English. Attackers can craft prompts in languages with weaker safety coverage to achieve prohibited objectives.
remediation_advice: Deploy comprehensive safety controls across all supported languages with equal rigor. Use language-agnostic safety principles and semantic analysis. Ensure multilingual training includes diverse attack patterns for all languages.
