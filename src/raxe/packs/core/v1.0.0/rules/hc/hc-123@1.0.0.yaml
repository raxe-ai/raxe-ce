risk_explanation: Malicious deepfake creation can be used for non-consensual pornography, defamation, fraud, impersonation, and blackmail. These synthetic media manipulations cause severe reputational, psychological, and sometimes financial harm.
remediation_advice: Refuse all malicious deepfake requests, especially involving non-consensual content. Provide information on deepfake detection instead. Report serious cases involving minors to authorities. Log all attempts.
