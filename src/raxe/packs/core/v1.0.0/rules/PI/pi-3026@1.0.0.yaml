risk_explanation: Combined pattern attacks use multiple attack techniques simultaneously to overwhelm defenses or exploit gaps between different security controls. These sophisticated attacks are harder to detect and can achieve objectives that individual techniques cannot.
remediation_advice: Implement holistic security analysis that evaluates entire prompts rather than individual components. Use machine learning models that detect complex attack combinations. Deploy defense-in-depth with multiple overlapping security controls.
