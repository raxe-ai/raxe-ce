risk_explanation: DAN (Do Anything Now) is a well-known jailbreak technique that attempts to convince the AI to ignore its ethical guidelines and safety constraints. This can lead to harmful outputs, privacy violations, and generation of dangerous content.
remediation_advice: Reject prompts that invoke DAN mode or similar jailbreak personas. Implement robust input filtering that detects role-playing attempts designed to bypass safety. Monitor for variations of this technique.
