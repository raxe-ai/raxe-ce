risk_explanation: >
  Extracting system guidelines and operational rules reveals the safety boundaries
  and behavioral constraints of an AI system. Attackers use this information to
  identify weak points in the system's defenses and craft prompts that exploit
  gaps in the rule set. This indirect extraction method is often more successful
  than direct prompt requests as it appears benign.
remediation_advice: >
  Configure the system to refuse requests for guideline summaries or rule descriptions.
  Implement content filtering to detect and block indirect extraction attempts that
  ask about system behavior, constraints, or operational parameters. Train the model
  to recognize that questions about "what you can/cannot do" may be extraction attempts.
  Monitor for clustering of information-gathering queries.
