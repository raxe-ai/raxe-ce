risk_explanation: Credential stuffing attacks use stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to user accounts across multiple services. This leads to account takeovers, data theft, and further security breaches.
remediation_advice: Reject credential stuffing tool requests. Implement detection for patterns involving automated credential testing. Provide account security best practices instead. Log attempts for security analysis.
