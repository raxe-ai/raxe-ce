risk_explanation: API key exposure in prompts, responses, or training data creates
  critical security vulnerabilities. Leaked API keys grant attackers access to cloud
  services, third-party platforms, and internal systems, potentially leading to data
  breaches, resource abuse, or financial fraud.
remediation_advice: Scan all data sources for API keys before AI processing. Implement
  automated key rotation and revocation. Use secret detection tools in development
  and production pipelines. Never log or persist API keys. Apply access controls to
  prevent AI systems from accessing key stores.
