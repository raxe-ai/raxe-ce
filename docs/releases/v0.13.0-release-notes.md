# RAXE CE v0.13.0

**February 2026**

---

## What's New

### MSSP Usage Visibility

MSSPs now have full visibility into their customer base -- active agents, scan volumes, and threat counts -- all from a single command or API call. Built for billing integrations, executive dashboards, and capacity planning.

### Tiered Customer Management

MSSP tiers now include built-in customer limits and per-customer agent caps, giving partners clear guardrails as they scale. Starter, Professional, and Enterprise tiers each come with defined boundaries so growth stays predictable.

### Partner Program Support

Dedicated NFR (Not-For-Resale) license keys let partners evaluate and demo the full platform -- rule-based and ML-powered detection -- without impacting production billing.

### Lightweight Deployments

RAXE now runs in L1-only mode when ML dependencies aren't present, automatically and without configuration. This means a ~50MB install for environments that only need rule-based detection, compared to ~1.2GB for the full stack. Deploy where it makes sense, at the size that fits.

### Improved Health Checks

`raxe doctor` now surfaces ML dependency status, so operators can instantly see whether L2 detection is available and what's missing if it isn't.
