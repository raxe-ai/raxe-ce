risk_explanation: Autonomy override attacks attempt to disable an agent's ability
  to evaluate requests, effectively turning it into a blind executor. This
  removes critical safety checks and enables arbitrary command execution.
remediation_advice: Implement immutable safety evaluation that cannot be
  disabled. Require all actions to pass policy checks regardless of override
  attempts. Alert on autonomy manipulation attempts.
