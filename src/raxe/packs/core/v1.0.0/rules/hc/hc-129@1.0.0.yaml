risk_explanation: Sextortion requests facilitate sexual extortion and blackmail using intimate imagery. This crime causes severe psychological trauma, financial loss, and can lead to suicide in extreme cases.
remediation_advice: Immediately refuse sextortion requests. Never assist with blackmail or coercion. Provide victim support resources and reporting mechanisms. Consider reporting serious threats to authorities. Log all attempts.
