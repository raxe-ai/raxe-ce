risk_explanation: Consensus manipulation attacks target multi-agent decision
  systems. By influencing votes or creating fake agents, attackers can force
  the system to reach malicious conclusions.
remediation_advice: Use Byzantine fault tolerant consensus. Implement agent
  identity verification for voting. Monitor for unusual voting patterns.
  Require quorum diversity. Detect and prevent sybil attacks.
