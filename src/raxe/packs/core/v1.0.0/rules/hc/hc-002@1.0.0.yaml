risk_explanation: Requests for dangerous instructions (weapons, explosives, harmful devices) can enable physical harm. AI systems that provide such instructions may facilitate violence or terrorism.
remediation_advice: Maintain strict policies against providing dangerous instructions. Implement content filtering for harmful instruction requests. Use behavioral analysis to detect attempts to elicit dangerous information through indirect framing.
