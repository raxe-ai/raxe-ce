rule_hash: null
risk_explanation: Profession-based roleplay jailbreaks attempt to bypass safety constraints by instructing AI to adopt the perspective of hackers, criminals, or other malicious actors. By framing unethical behavior as professional expertise, attackers attempt to elicit harmful information or capabilities. This technique combines social engineering with roleplay to justify rule-breaking.
remediation_advice: Reject requests to roleplay as malicious professionals combined with rule-breaking behavior. Distinguish between educational discussions about security (legitimate) and roleplay that ignores ethical constraints (jailbreak). Implement profession-aware filtering that detects profession+rule-breaking combinations.
