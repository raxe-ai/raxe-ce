risk_explanation: Dangerous Unix commands (dd, rm -rf, mkfs) can destroy data, corrupt file systems, or cause denial of service. These commands are particularly risky because they can cause irrecoverable damage to systems and data.
remediation_advice: Implement strict command allowlisting that excludes dangerous utilities. Use read-only file systems where possible. Deploy command execution monitoring and anomaly detection. Restrict access to destructive commands through permissions.
