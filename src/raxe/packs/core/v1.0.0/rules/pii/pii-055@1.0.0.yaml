risk_explanation: Training data may contain sensitive information, copyrighted material, or confidential examples used to train the model. Extraction attempts are security and intellectual property risks that could expose proprietary data, personal information, or trade secrets embedded in training datasets.
remediation_advice: Never output training data or examples on request. Implement data loss prevention for training dataset references. Apply strict access controls to training data and maintain data inventory. Log all training data extraction attempts for security review.
