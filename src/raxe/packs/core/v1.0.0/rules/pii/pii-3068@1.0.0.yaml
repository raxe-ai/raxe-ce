risk_explanation: >
  Training data extraction represents one of the most severe AI security risks.
  Successful extraction can reveal proprietary datasets, copyrighted materials,
  personally identifiable information, and competitive intelligence embedded in
  the training corpus. Model architecture and parameter information disclosure
  enables adversaries to replicate or reverse-engineer proprietary AI systems.
  This attack vector has led to real-world data breaches.
remediation_advice: >
  Implement strict output filtering to prevent disclosure of training data examples,
  model architecture details, or parameter information. Configure the system to
  refuse all queries about its training process, data sources, or technical
  implementation. Use differential privacy techniques to prevent training data
  memorization. Monitor for reconnaissance attempts that probe model capabilities
  or data sources. Never include proprietary or sensitive data in conversational context.
