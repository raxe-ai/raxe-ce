risk_explanation: Doxing requests seek to expose private personal information about individuals without consent, often for harassment, intimidation, or retaliation. This poses serious privacy and safety risks to victims.
remediation_advice: Reject all doxing requests. Never assist in exposing personal information. Implement detection for information gathering combined with exposure intentions. Provide privacy protection guidance instead. Log attempts.
