risk_explanation: Ransomware creation requests attempt to generate malicious code that encrypts victim files and demands payment for decryption. This is a serious cybercrime that causes significant financial and operational damage to organizations and individuals.
remediation_advice: Reject all ransomware creation requests regardless of stated purpose. Implement content filtering that detects encryption-plus-payment patterns. Monitor for discussions combining file encryption with financial demands. Log these attempts for security review.
