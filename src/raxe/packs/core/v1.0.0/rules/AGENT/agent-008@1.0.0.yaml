sub_family: goal_drift
name: Detects multi-turn goal drift patterns
description: Detects gradual manipulation across multiple turns designed to slowly
  drift an agent away from its original objective.
  Maps to OWASP ASI01 (Agent Goal Hijack).

risk_explanation: Goal drift attacks use incremental manipulation to gradually
  shift an agent's behavior toward malicious objectives. Each step may seem
  innocuous but the cumulative effect achieves the attacker's goal.
remediation_advice: Implement session-level goal tracking. Alert on significant
  deviation from original task. Use periodic goal validation checkpoints.
  Limit session duration for sensitive tasks.
