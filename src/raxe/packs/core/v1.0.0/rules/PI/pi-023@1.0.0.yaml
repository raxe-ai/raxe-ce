risk_explanation: Abbreviated attack patterns use shortened forms of malicious instructions to evade keyword-based detection while retaining semantic meaning. Common abbreviations like 'DAN', 'ig prev inst' can bypass simple pattern matching while still triggering harmful behaviors.
remediation_advice: Expand detection patterns to include common abbreviations and shortened forms. Use semantic analysis that identifies intent regardless of textual format. Maintain a database of known abbreviated attack patterns and update it regularly.
