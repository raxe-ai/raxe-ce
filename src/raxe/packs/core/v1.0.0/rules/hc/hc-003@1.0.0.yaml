risk_explanation: Specific weapon instruction requests target detailed information about creating or using weapons. This information can directly enable violence and poses severe safety risks.
remediation_advice: Block all specific weapon instruction requests. Implement specialized detection for weapon-related terminology and concepts. Use semantic analysis to identify weapon requests regardless of phrasing. Alert security teams of such requests.
