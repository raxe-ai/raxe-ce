# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a **harassment-free experience for everyone**, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an **open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community**.

## Our Standards

- ✅ Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- ✅ Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- ✅ Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- ✅ Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the community
- ✅ Showing empathy towards other community members
- ✅ Using welcoming and inclusive language

### Unacceptable Behaviors

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- ❌ The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- ❌ Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- ❌ Public or private harassment
- ❌ Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Slack workspace
- Twitter and social media
- Email communications
- Community events (online and in-person)
- Any other forum created by the project team

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**conduct@raxe.ai**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Confidentiality

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.

- Do not exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain
- Give maintainers reasonable time to address issues

### Technical Discussions

- Focus on technical merit, not personal attacks
- Welcome constructive criticism
- Acknowledge when you're wrong
- Be humble about what you don't know

### AGI Safety Discussions

- Respect diverse viewpoints on AI safety and governance
