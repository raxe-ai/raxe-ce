# RAXE Policy Template: Learning Mode
#
# Use Case: Initial deployment, building detection baselines
#
# Behavior:
# - All detections logged to database
# - Nothing blocked (passive monitoring)
# - Build understanding of false positive rates
# - Safe for production rollout
#
# Duration: Run for 1-2 weeks to establish baseline
#
# Next Steps:
# 1. Review logs: raxe stats
# 2. Identify false positives
# 3. Graduate to balanced.yaml or strict.yaml
