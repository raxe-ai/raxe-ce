risk_explanation: Network information exposure (IP addresses, MAC addresses, SSH keys) can enable reconnaissance, targeted attacks, or lateral movement within networks. This information helps attackers map infrastructure and identify potential entry points.
remediation_advice: Implement network segmentation and access controls. Use private IP addressing and NAT where appropriate. Monitor for network information leakage. Apply principles of least privilege for network access.
