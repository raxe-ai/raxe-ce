  gap_addressed: "Jailbreak - evil character roleplay (validation gap: 30% miss rate)"
rule_hash: null
risk_explanation: Evil character roleplay attempts to jailbreak AI systems by instructing them to adopt malicious personas that ignore safety constraints. By framing harmful behavior as "in-character" actions, attackers attempt to bypass ethical guidelines and elicit prohibited content. This technique is particularly effective against systems with creative roleplay capabilities.
remediation_advice: Reject all requests to roleplay as evil, malicious, or unethical entities. Maintain consistent safety guidelines regardless of fictional framing. Implement persona validation that prevents adoption of harmful characters. Log all character roleplay jailbreak attempts for security analysis.
