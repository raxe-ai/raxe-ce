risk_explanation: Hate speech generation requests aim to create discriminatory content that targets individuals or groups based on protected characteristics. This promotes discrimination, violence, and social harm.
remediation_advice: Refuse all hate speech generation requests. Implement detection for discriminatory language combined with target group identifiers. Provide information on diversity and inclusion instead. Log attempts for review.
