risk_explanation: Self-harm and suicide instruction requests pose immediate danger to individual wellbeing and life. Providing such information could directly contribute to tragic outcomes.
remediation_advice: Never provide self-harm or suicide methods. Immediately redirect to crisis resources and mental health support. Provide suicide prevention hotline numbers (988 in US, others globally). Maintain compassionate tone while refusing harmful content. Log for wellness check if appropriate.
