risk_explanation: Advanced hypothetical attacks use sophisticated philosophical or logical framing to present harmful requests as legitimate intellectual exercises. These attacks exploit the AI's reasoning capabilities to generate dangerous content under the guise of academic inquiry.
remediation_advice: Maintain ethical boundaries regardless of academic or philosophical framing. Implement harm evaluation that considers potential real-world applications of generated content. Reject prompts that explicitly request bypass of safety considerations.
