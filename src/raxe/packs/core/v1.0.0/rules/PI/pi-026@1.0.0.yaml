risk_explanation: Prompt injection attacks attempt to override system instructions to make the AI ignore its safety guidelines and security controls. This can lead to unauthorized actions, data leakage, bypassing of access controls, or generation of harmful content that violates system policies.
remediation_advice: Implement robust input validation that detects and blocks instruction override attempts. Use layered prompt engineering with clearly defined boundaries that separate system instructions from user input. Deploy a secondary validation layer to verify responses comply with safety policies.
