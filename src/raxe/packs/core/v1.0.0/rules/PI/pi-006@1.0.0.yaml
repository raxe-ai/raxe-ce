risk_explanation: System prompt override attacks target the foundational instructions that define AI behavior. Successful attacks can completely compromise the AI's security posture, allowing attackers to bypass all safety measures and extract sensitive information.
remediation_advice: Implement immutable system prompts that cannot be overridden by user input. Use separate contexts for system and user inputs. Add monitoring to detect repeated override attempts.
