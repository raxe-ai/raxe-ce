risk_explanation: Advanced fiction framing disguises harmful requests within elaborate narrative contexts, storytelling scenarios, or creative writing exercises. This technique exploits the complexity of story generation to sneak past safety controls while generating harmful content.
remediation_advice: Implement content-based evaluation that assesses actual output harm rather than narrative context. Use semantic analysis to identify harmful content disguised as fiction. Apply safety controls to all creative outputs.
