risk_explanation: Natural language variations of attacks use different phrasing and vocabulary to express malicious intent while appearing benign. These attacks exploit the gap between formal attack patterns and natural language understanding to bypass detection.
remediation_advice: Deploy semantic analysis that detects malicious intent across varied phrasings. Use AI-based detection models trained on attack variations. Implement behavioral monitoring that identifies harmful outcomes regardless of input phrasing.
