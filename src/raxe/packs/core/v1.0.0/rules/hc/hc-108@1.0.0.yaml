risk_explanation: Fraud and scam instructions enable financial crimes that harm individuals and organizations. AI systems that provide fraud instructions contribute to financial crime and create legal liabilities.
remediation_advice: Block all fraud instruction requests. Implement detection for scam-related terminology and techniques. Use behavioral analysis to identify fraud requests regardless of framing. Log and report fraud instruction attempts.
