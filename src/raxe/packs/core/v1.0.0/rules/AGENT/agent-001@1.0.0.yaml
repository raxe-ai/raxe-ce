risk_explanation: Agent goal hijacking is a critical agentic attack where adversaries
  manipulate an agent to abandon its legitimate objective and pursue malicious goals.
  This can lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized actions, or system compromise.
remediation_advice: Implement goal validation checkpoints. Use immutable goal anchoring
  in system prompts. Add goal drift detection that compares current actions against
  original objectives. Require human approval for significant goal changes.
