risk_explanation: Private key exposure (RSA, SSH, PGP keys) completely compromises
  cryptographic security. Attackers with private keys can decrypt sensitive data,
  forge signatures, impersonate key owners, and gain unauthorized access to systems.
remediation_advice: Store private keys in hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure
  key management systems. Never transmit or log private keys. Implement key rotation
  and revocation procedures. Use separate keys for different purposes with appropriate
  access controls.
