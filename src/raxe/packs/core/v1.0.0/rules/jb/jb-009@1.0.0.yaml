risk_explanation: Fiction framing attacks attempt to trick AI into operating in a hypothetical context without ethical constraints. By framing requests as fictional scenarios, attackers try to bypass safety mechanisms and elicit harmful responses.
remediation_advice: Maintain ethical guidelines regardless of fictional or hypothetical framing. Implement context-aware filtering that recognizes framing attempts. Train models to decline requests that invoke worlds without rules or ethics.
