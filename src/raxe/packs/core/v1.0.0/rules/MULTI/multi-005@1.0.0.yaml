risk_explanation: Coordination hijacking gives attackers control over the entire
  multi-agent system. By taking over the orchestrator, attackers can direct
  all subordinate agents to perform malicious actions.
remediation_advice: Use tamper-proof orchestrator identity. Implement Byzantine
  fault tolerance. Require multi-signature for coordination changes. Monitor
  for unexpected coordinator assertions.
