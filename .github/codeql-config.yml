query-filters:
  # py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data
  # FALSE POSITIVE: We log installation_id (machine UUID), key_type (tier label),
  # and api_key_id (truncated SHA-256 hash). None of these are actual secrets.
  # The actual API key is NEVER logged.

  # py/weak-sensitive-data-hashing
  # FALSE POSITIVE: CodeQL incorrectly flagged SHA-256 as "weak". SHA-256 is
  # appropriate for our use case (privacy fingerprinting and identifier derivation),
  # not password hashing. bcrypt/argon2 would be needed only for password storage.
