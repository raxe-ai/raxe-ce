risk_explanation: False urgency attacks create artificial pressure to bypass
  normal security procedures. Attackers exploit the tendency to act quickly
  in perceived emergencies, leading to security control circumvention.
remediation_advice: Implement mandatory security checks that cannot be bypassed
  regardless of urgency claims. Train agents to recognize urgency manipulation.
  Require multi-factor approval for emergency overrides.
