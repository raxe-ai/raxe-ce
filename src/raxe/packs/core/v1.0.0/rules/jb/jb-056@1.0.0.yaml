risk_explanation: Extended role-playing combines persona adoption with additional attack vectors like data exfiltration or privilege escalation. These sophisticated attacks use roleplay as a foundation for more complex multi-stage exploits.
remediation_advice: Apply defense-in-depth that addresses both roleplay and secondary attack vectors. Use behavioral monitoring to detect escalation from roleplay to malicious actions. Implement strict data access controls regardless of roleplay context.
