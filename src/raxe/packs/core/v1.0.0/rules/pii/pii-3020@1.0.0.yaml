risk_explanation: Financial credential exposure (account numbers, routing numbers, cryptocurrency addresses) enables direct financial fraud and theft. Attackers can initiate unauthorized transactions, drain accounts, or conduct money laundering operations.
remediation_advice: Apply PCI DSS and financial data security standards. Use encryption and tokenization for financial data. Implement transaction monitoring and fraud detection. Restrict AI access to financial systems and data stores.
