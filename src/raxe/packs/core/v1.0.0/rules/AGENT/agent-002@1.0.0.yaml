risk_explanation: Objective substitution attacks use social engineering tactics to
  convince an agent that its understanding of its mission is incorrect, replacing
  legitimate goals with attacker-controlled objectives.
remediation_advice: Implement objective anchoring with cryptographic verification.
  Reject objective modifications that don't come from authorized sources. Log all
  objective change attempts for audit.
