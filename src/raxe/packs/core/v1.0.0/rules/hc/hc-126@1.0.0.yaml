risk_explanation: Botnet creation requests seek to build networks of compromised devices for malicious purposes including DDoS attacks, spam distribution, and cryptocurrency mining. Botnets enable large-scale attacks and criminal operations.
remediation_advice: Reject all botnet creation requests. Implement detection for C2 infrastructure and malware propagation patterns. Provide botnet defense information instead. Report serious attempts to security teams.
