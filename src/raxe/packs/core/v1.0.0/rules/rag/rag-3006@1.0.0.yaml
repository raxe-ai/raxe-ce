risk_explanation: Tampering attacks alter existing documents or indices to change retrieval behavior. Unlike poisoning, these attacks modify authentic content to inject misinformation while maintaining apparent legitimacy.
remediation_advice: Use cryptographic hashing and digital signatures for document integrity. Implement version control and change tracking. Deploy anomaly detection for document modifications. Maintain backup copies of authoritative sources.
