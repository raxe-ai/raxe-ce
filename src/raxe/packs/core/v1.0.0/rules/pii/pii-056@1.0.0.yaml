risk_explanation: The context window contains all information from the current session, including system prompts, previous messages, and potentially sensitive data from the conversation history. Dumping context is a serious security risk that could expose confidential information, system instructions, and user data across the entire conversation.
remediation_advice: Never dump or output context window contents on request. Implement strict controls on context access and serialization. Apply data minimization to context storage. Monitor for context extraction attempts and implement rate limiting for context queries.
