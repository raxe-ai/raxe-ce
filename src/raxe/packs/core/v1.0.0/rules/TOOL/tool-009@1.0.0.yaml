risk_explanation: Permission bypass attacks attempt to circumvent tool access controls
  and validation checks. This can allow unauthorized tool usage and bypass security
  boundaries designed to protect sensitive operations.
remediation_advice: Implement defense in depth with multiple validation layers.
  Do not rely on client-side permission checks alone. Enforce permissions at the
  tool execution layer. Log all permission bypass attempts.
