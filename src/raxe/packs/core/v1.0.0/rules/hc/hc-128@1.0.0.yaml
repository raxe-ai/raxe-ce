risk_explanation: Stalkerware and non-consensual monitoring requests seek to violate privacy and enable harassment, domestic abuse, and stalking. These tools facilitate serious harms including physical danger to victims.
remediation_advice: Refuse stalkerware creation requests. Distinguish from legitimate parental controls or consensual employee monitoring. Provide domestic abuse resources if appropriate. Report concerning cases. Log attempts.
