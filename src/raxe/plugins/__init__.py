Plugin System - WebAssembly Runtime (Placeholder)

Future: WebAssembly plugin system for custom detectors.

This allows community-contributed detectors that are:
    - Sandboxed (memory + CPU limits)
    - Language-agnostic (compiled to WASM)
    - Hot-reloadable
    - Distributed via plugin marketplace

To be implemented in future iterations.
