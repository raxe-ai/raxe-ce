risk_explanation: Authority exploitation leverages claimed credentials, titles,
  or organizational position to pressure agents into compliance. Agents may
  be manipulated by appeals to authority that bypass normal security checks.
remediation_advice: Never grant elevated access based on claimed titles.
  Implement proper authentication for privileged operations. Train agents
  to recognize social engineering patterns.
