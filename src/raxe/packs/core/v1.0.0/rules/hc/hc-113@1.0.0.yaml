risk_explanation: Violence incitement requests seek to create content that provokes physical harm or violent actions. This poses serious public safety risks and can lead to real-world violence and criminal activity.
remediation_advice: Immediately reject all violence incitement requests. Implement strict filtering for patterns combining action planning with violence or harm. Report serious threats to appropriate authorities. Maintain detailed logs of these attempts.
