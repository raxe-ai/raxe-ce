risk_explanation: Swatting requests seek to weaponize emergency services against innocent victims. These hoax calls waste critical resources, endanger lives, and can result in serious injury or death.
remediation_advice: Immediately refuse swatting requests. These are serious crimes with severe consequences. Report credible swatting attempts to law enforcement. Provide emergency services education instead. Log all attempts.
