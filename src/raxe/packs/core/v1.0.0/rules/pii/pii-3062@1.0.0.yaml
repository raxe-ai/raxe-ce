risk_explanation: LLM memory extraction attacks attempt to retrieve information from previous interactions, other users' conversations, or training data. Successful extraction can leak sensitive information across security boundaries and violate user privacy.
remediation_advice: Implement proper conversation isolation and memory boundaries. Use access controls that prevent cross-user information leakage. Deploy privacy-preserving techniques in training and fine-tuning. Monitor for memory extraction attempts.
