risk_explanation: Identity assertion attacks exploit trust by falsely claiming authority
  or special access rights. Agents may be manipulated into believing they must
  comply with instructions from a supposed administrator or creator.
remediation_advice: Implement cryptographic identity verification. Never trust
  identity claims in user input. Use separate authenticated channels for
  administrative commands. Log all authority assertions.
