risk_explanation: Social engineering attacks manipulate human psychology to bypass technical security controls and extract sensitive information. These attacks exploit trust and authority to gain unauthorized access to systems and data.
remediation_advice: Reject all social engineering attack creation requests. Implement training-focused responses when users ask about social engineering. Monitor for patterns involving psychological manipulation combined with information extraction. Log attempts for security review.
